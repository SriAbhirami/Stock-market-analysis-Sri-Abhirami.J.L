Stock Market Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project showcases an in-depth analysis and predictive modeling of stock market trends using historical data from four leading tech companies: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOGL).

🔍 Project Highlights
Objective: Analyze stock performance and predict future closing prices using machine learning techniques.

Duration Covered: 3 months of daily stock data.

Tools & Technologies:

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Excel, SQL, and Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured historical stock data with no missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations like scatter plots, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and volume trends.

Feature Engineering: Moving Averages, Volatility, Time-based features, and Daily Returns.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Linear Regression model with performance metrics (MSE: 2.28, R²: 0.9997).

Predicted closing prices based on open, high, low, and volume features.

Results & Insights: Found strong correlations and business insights from stock behavior.

🔮 Future Scope
Integrate real-time data using APIs like yfinance.

Add advanced ML models (XGBoost, LSTM).

Perform sentiment analysis from financial news.

Deploy an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI.
